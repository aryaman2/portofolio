# Portfolio

Welcome to my neon-powered developer portfolio!  
This is not your average boring resume site — it's built with pure HTML5 + CSS3 (and a sprinkle of JS) to flex my front-end skills with some style 🤘

## ✨ Features

- 💥 Custom cursor that follows you around
- 🫧 Floating CSS blobs (because why not?)
- 🧠 Responsive layout with semantic HTML5
- 🔮 Animated glowing cards for projects
- 📥 Downloadable resume
- 📍 Embedded Google Maps for location flex

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- HTML5 (semantic and clean)
- CSS3 (internal, with custom animations & layout)
- Tiny bit of vanilla JavaScript (for cursor magic)
